# Garzoni annotation datasets

This repository contains the Garzoni annotation datasets, which can also be explored and downloaded from the [Garzoni exploration interface](https://garzoni.dhlab.epfl.ch).

Please note that normalization information is still missing for some location names. It will be uploaded during Spring 2019.
