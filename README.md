### About
The [Garzoni project](https://garzoni.org) studied Apprenticeship, Work, and Society (GAWS) in Early Modern Venice using the Accordi dei Garzoni, a series of apprenticeship contracts from the Venetian State Archive, encompassing around 55,000 contracts from 1573 to 1772. These contracts detail apprentice employment, including the roles of the Master, Apprentice, and Guarantor, as well as the apprenticeship terms like duration, profession, salary, and working conditions.

The project involved an interdisciplinary team and had two main phases. The first phase focused on creating an information system to collect, store, process, and display data from the contracts. The second phase involved historical research on topics like the apprenticeship economy, skill transmission, family roles, gender impact, and worker migration flows.

GAWS was co-funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation under grant
No. [CR12I1L_156272](https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/156272) and by the French National Research Agency (ANR).
